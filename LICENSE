 This software is provided as is and free of charge.  It can be redesigned, redistributed,
 refrigerated, remade, reheated, and regifted in part or in whole by any person, corporation, rodent, or wet floor sign
 for fun or profit or hookers and blow. Marsupials, and all other inanimate objects are prohibited from using this software.
 In exchange, just give me credit for inspiring you to steal my code like Carlos Mencia steals jokes.  I steal a bunch too so you're
 probably just getting sloppy seconds anyways. Shout out to Stack Exchange/Overflow for giving me help via shitty code snippets whenever 
 I got stuck.

 Keep in mind I'm not a dev and can barely write good English let alone good code.  This software is likely buggy as hell 
 and is provided AS IS with no warranty real, imagined, fabricated, fornicated or pulled from a magic hat that this software is 
 suitable for any purpose, porpise, or tortise, unless it's also a florist.  To be honest, you probably should not even use this in any
 environment you want to have working right. If by some miracle this code works and you see me at a con then you owe me beer or some kind 
 of booze except for smirnoff ice because that shit is fucking gross.

 In short, you can't sue me if you decide to use this code that I'm putting out there for free and shit goes terribly wrong. I'm talking
 deleting your root with no backups type of bad shit happenning. I'm just as broke as this code and you'll just be pissing into the wind
 on that endeavor.  I already warned you that my code is bad.  Read through it and make sure you know what it does, or have your cousin
 that took a web design class in high school help you figure out what it does.
 


 ...Or just take my word for it and wing it. #YOLO
